// This file contains the declarations of the Vectorization Plan base classes:
// 1. VPBasicBlock and VPRegionBlock that inherit from a common pure virtual
//    VPBlockBase, together implementing a Hierarchical CFG;
// 2. Specializations of GraphTraits that allow VPBlockBase graphs to be treated
//    as proper graphs for generic algorithms;
// 3. Pure virtual VPRecipeBase and its pure virtual sub-classes
//    VPConditionBitRecipeBase and VPOneByOneRecipeBase that
//    represent base classes for recipes contained within VPBasicBlocks;
// 4. The VPlan class holding a candidate for vectorization;
// 5. The VPlanUtils class providing methods for building plans;
// 6. The VPlanPrinter class providing a way to print a plan in dot format.
// These are documented in docs/VectorizationPlan.rst.

/// the Recipe. A Recipe specifies how its ingredients are to be vectorized:
/// e.g., copy or reuse them as uniform, scalarize or vectorize them according
/// to an enclosing loop dimension, vectorize them according to internal SLP
/// dimension.
///
/// **Design principle:** in order to reason about how to vectorize an
/// Instruction or how much it would cost, one has to consult the VPRecipe
/// holding it.
///
/// **Design principle:** when a sequence of instructions conveys additional
/// information as a group, we use a VPRecipe to encapsulate them and attach
/// this information to the VPRecipe. For instance a VPRecipe can model an
/// interleave group of loads or stores with additional information for
/// calculating their cost and for performing IR code generation, as a group.
///
/// **Design principle:** a VPRecipe should reuse existing containers of its
/// ingredients, i.e., iterators of basic blocks, to be lightweight. A new
/// containter should be opened on-demand, e.g., to avoid excessive recipes
/// each holding an interval of ingredients.
